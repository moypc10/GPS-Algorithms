# GPS Route Planning Optimizer

## Overview

The GPS Route Planning Optimizer project is a C++ based simulator developed between November 2023 and December 2023. The primary objective of this project is to optimize route planning algorithms to enable efficient navigation to various destinations. 

## Features

- **Algorithm Optimization:** The project implements advanced algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Dijkstra's algorithm. These algorithms are utilized to comprehensively analyze and determine the most optimal routes based on diverse parameters and constraints.
  
- **Intuitive User Interface:** A user-friendly interface has been designed to display and present the top three recommended routes to the user. This interface ensures ease of use and enhances the overall user experience.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   
2. Compile the C++ files using your preferred compiler.
   
3. Run the executable file.
   
4. Follow the instructions on the user interface to input your destination and preferences.
   
5. View the recommended routes presented by the application.
